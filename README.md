The purpose of this is to provide a datatype which expands past the 2.147 billion primitive int 32-bit size limit.

Currently, this datatype supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and greatest common divisor operations.
It can also up to 2.147 billion digits (a number of length 2.147 billion), which is the maximum size of the array indexing.
